## I have an issue!

Please report all issues to the [Issues](https://github.com/lucidinceptor/Funky-Frogs/labels) page for the mod.

- To request support for a modded cosmetic, make an issue using the "mod cosmetic support" tag. (Note that I might not be able to support all cosmetics, but I will try to add any I can when I have the time)
- For issues with base game cosmetics, such as cosmetics not displaying properly on frogs, make an issue using the "cosmetic issue" tag. Most should be working but I don't have all of them to test yet.
